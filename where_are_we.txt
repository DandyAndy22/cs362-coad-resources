	2.3		Created a diagram: draw a rough ER or UML diagram that uses a box for each model class, and annotate the attributes of each class.

	2.5  draw a line representing each relationship you find. Then, annotate each line with either 1:1, 1:M, and M:N to describe the cardinality of the relationship.
