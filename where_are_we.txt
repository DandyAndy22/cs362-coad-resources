Justin
	2.1
	Take a look at the app/models directory, and write down the names of the classes. Given your experience in using the app (Step 1.4 above), write down a short description of what each class represents. This is a draft of your present understanding, and you'll revise this later.

	Next, add a brief comment above each model class definition that contains your description.


Andras
	2.3	Create a diagram: draw a rough ER or UML diagram that uses a box for each model class, and annotate the attributes of each class.
 
	2.5 Draw a line representing each relationship you find. Then, annotate each line with either 1:1, 1:M, and M:N to describe the cardinality of the relationship.

-----------------------------
	2.4 Refactor tests: Now that your instantiation tests pass - delete them.


	3.2: Implement tests for
	find_or_create_by 
		models/region 
		models/resource_category


	5.2: Finish controller tests

	7:  Where are we implementing fakes, stubs and mocks?
		Let's write it down
